# CrCo Token

CrCo Token is an ERC20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain. The token is implemented using Solidity and leverages OpenZeppelin's library for secure and robust smart contract development.

## Features

- **ERC20 Standard**: Implements the standard ERC20 interface.
- **Access Control**: Uses role-based access control to manage permissions.
- **Reentrancy Guard**: Protects against reentrancy attacks.

## Installation

To use or modify this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/codernotme/crco.git
cd crco
npm install
```

## Smart Contract

The main contract `CrCoToken.sol` is located in the `contracts` directory.

### CrCoToken.sol

This contract implements the following features:
- **Minting**: Allows addresses with the `MINTER_ROLE` to mint new tokens.
- **Burning**: Allows addresses with the `BURNER_ROLE` to burn tokens.

### Roles

- `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: The default admin role assigned to the contract deployer.
- `MINTER_ROLE`: Role required to mint new tokens.
- `BURNER_ROLE`: Role required to burn tokens.

## Deployment

To deploy the smart contract, use the following command (make sure you have configured your Ethereum provider and wallet):

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

## Usage

### Minting Tokens

Only addresses with the `MINTER_ROLE` can mint tokens.

```solidity
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE);
```

### Burning Tokens

Only addresses with the `BURNER_ROLE` can burn tokens.

```solidity
function burn(address from, uint256 amount) external onlyRole(BURNER_ROLE);
```
